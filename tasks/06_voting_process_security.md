# ✅ Task: Implement Secure Voting Process

## 🧠 Context
The voting process needs security enhancements to:
1. Ensure one vote per voter
2. Prevent session hijacking
3. Maintain audit trail
4. Secure the vote submission

## 🔧 Actions
1. Add `has_voted` flag to voters table
2. Implement vote confirmation screen
3. Add CSRF protection to vote submission
4. Create voting audit log table
5. Secure vote transmission (HTTPS required)
6. Implement session timeout

## 🗃️ Files to Modify/Create
- `database/e-stem_suriname.sql` (add audit table)
- `src/controllers/vote.php` (security updates)
- `src/views/vote_confirm.php` (new)
- `include/auth.php` (session handling)
- `pages/vote_success.php` (update)

## 📎 Testing
- Verify can't vote twice
- Test session expiration
- Check audit logs record votes
- Verify CSRF protection works

## ⚠️ Constraints
- Must maintain existing vote data
- Don't break results calculation
- Keep user experience smooth
